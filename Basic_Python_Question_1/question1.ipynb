    "In Python, lambda is a keyword used to create small, anonymous functions, also known as lambda functions or closures. A lambda function is a concise way to define a function without a name, using the lambda keyword.\n",

    "1. As event handlers: Lambda functions can be used as event handlers, such as button clicks or mouse movements.\n",
    "2. In data processing: Lambda functions can be used to perform data transformations, filtering, or mapping.\n",
    "3. As higher-order functions: Lambda functions can be passed as arguments to other functions or returned as values from functions.\n",
    "4. In functional programming: Lambda functions are used extensively in functional programming techniques, such as map, filter, and reduce.\n",
