    "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful and versatile supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. The fundamental concept of SVMs is to find the best possible boundary that separates different classes in the feature space. The primary goal of an SVM is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space. In a two-dimensional space, this hyperplane is a line, while in higher dimensions, it becomes a flat affine subspace.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Training: XGBoost deals with missing values directly. It chooses the best direction (left or right) at each split based on which option reduces the loss the most.\n",
